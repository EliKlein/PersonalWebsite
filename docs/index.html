                Hey, here's some stuff I'd like to tell you about who I am as a person:
                <ul>
                    <li>I try to think rationally and enjoy solving new logical problems.</li>
                    <li>When I'm not in a rush, I like to think of a new way to do what I'm doing.</li>
                    <li>I'm a very accepting person, whether it's people or problems.</li>
                    <li>I often take the time to reevaluate my opinions if they are challenged.</li>
                    <li>I make baking a hobby, though I spend much of my time on the internet.</li>
                    <li>I have trouble choosing or remembering "favorite" things, most of the time.</li>
                </ul>

                Here is a link to my most current resumé (date in file name):

                            </a>
                            is to a mostly-complete, albeit small game I worked on as a
                            part of a team for one quarter in college. It is written with
                            help from a library called Phaser, which has methods for dealing
                            with audio/image files in a much easier way than native JS.
                        </li>
                        <li>More to come (for instance if I remember something I did a long time ago)</li>
                    </ul>

                My current contact information is:

                        I will most likely not pick up upon seeing a strange number,
                        because of the enormous number of spam/scam/robo-calls that
                        have been happening lately, but I listen to voice mail</li>
