    <p id="info"><strong>Regular mode:</strong>
        <br/>Match cards that have the same number and same suit color.
        <br/>For example, the nine of hearts and the nine of diamonds are a match.
        <br/>
        <br/><strong>Complicated mode:</strong>
        <br/>Match cards based on what the image in the corner shows. Cards will disappear completely, and slide upwards to fill empty spaces.
        <br/>
        <br/><img src="valueInd.png" style="float:left">
        <br/>This symbol means you need to match two cards with the same number.
        <br/>For example, the ace of spaces matches the ace of diamonds, the ace of clubs, or the ace of hearts.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/><img src="suitInd.png" style="float:left">
        <br/>This symbol means you need to match two cards with the same suit. 
        <br/>Any two cards of the same suit will do, the numbers don't need to match.
        <br/>The suit colors do not matter in this mode, only their shapes.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>If there are no more matches to be made, a few new cards will fall in.

        Warning: The puzzle may currently be impossible to solve,
        or it may become impossible to solve depending on what pairs you find in what order.
        I currently have no idea what logic I could use to get around this.
