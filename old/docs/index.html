        Hey, here's some stuff I'd like to tell you about who I am as a person:
        <ul>
          <li>I try to think rationally and enjoy solving new logical problems.</li>
          <li>When I'm not in a rush, I like to think of a new way to do what I'm doing.</li>
          <li>I'm a very accepting person, whether it's people or problems.</li>
          <li>I often take the time to reevaluate my opinions if they are challenged.</li>
          <li>I make baking a hobby, though I spend much of my time on the internet.</li>
          <li>I have trouble choosing or remembering "favorite" things, most of the time.</li>
          <li>I tend to be honest. For example, I avoid false praise.</li>
        </ul>

            is a project for Rithm School that was part of the pre-work related to creating this website.
            The goal of this project was to create a "meme generator" that lets you put arbitrary text
            on top of arbitrary images.

          <li>
            <a href="memory/page.html">This</a>
            is a link to a similar project. The goal for this project was to create a memory game.

            is to a mostly-complete, albeit small game I worked on as a
            part of a team for one quarter in college. It is written with
            help from a library called Phaser, which has methods for dealing
            with audio/image files much more easily than you can with basic JS.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://eliklein.github.io/PersonalWebsite/">This</a>
            is a React application I designed that demonstrates [insert standard recursion joke].

            As I say in my voice mail, I will most likely not pick up upon seeing a strange number.
            There have been an enormous number of spam/scam/robo-calls lately,
            but I listen to voice mail because hardly any of them bother to leave voice mails.
