                Hey, here's some stuff I'd like to tell you about who I am as a person:
                <ul>
                    <li>I try to think rationally and enjoy solving new logical problems.</li>
                    <li>When I'm not in a rush, I like to think of a new way to do what I'm doing.</li>
                    <li>I'm a very accepting person, whether it's people or problems.</li>
                    <li>I often take the time to reevaluate my opinions if they are challenged.</li>
                    <li>I make baking a hobby, though I spend much of my time on the internet.</li>
                    <li>I have trouble choosing or remembering "favorite" things, most of the time.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="content" id="resume">
                Here is a link to my most current resumé (date included in actual file name):
                <p><a href="test.txt">Klein_Elias_Resume.pdf</a></p>
                [todo: make and link resume]

                                This link
                            </a>
                            is to a mostly-complete, albeit small game I worked on as a
                            part of a team in college. It is written with help from a
                            library called Phaser, which has methods for dealing with
                            audio/image files in a much easier way than native JS.
                        </li>
                        <li>More to come (for instance if I remember something I did a long time ago)</li>
                    </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="content" id="contact">
                My current contact information is (limited to):
                <ul id="contactInfoList">
                    <li>Email: eskklein@comcast.net</li>
                </ul>
                I check my email approximately once per day on average.
                If I don't get back to you for 3 or more days, I may
                have overlooked it or forgotten to get back to responding
                (as I often check email when I have other things to do soon after).
