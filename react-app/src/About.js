            I'm always curious about how things work, or if things work. I
            dive into new technologies to find out exactly what makes them
            tick. I also sometimes experiment with bizarre code (on my own) to
            see if it does what I think it will.
          </li>
          <li>
            I accept things for what they are. When I want things to change,
            it's based in solid reasoning, and I have the ability to instigate
            the change I want.
          </li>
          <li>
            I listen to others, and I'm good at acting on criticism. Honestly,
            in person I probably seem like I'm making excuses, but I do that
            to help myself understand what I can do better.
          </li>
          <li>
            I avoid false praise because I don't like lying. If I'm not a
            fan of something, I still know what parts I do appreciate, and
            if I can't focus on that, I think about what could be improved.

            I'd like to mention some hobbies now:
            <ul className="About-SubList">
              <li>Video/board/role-playing/card Games</li>
              <li>Baking (not cooking)</li>
              <li>Crossword puzzles (New York Times app)</li>
              <li>Puns (maybe more of a personality trait than a hobby)</li>
              <li>Netflix/etc. (I like anime in particular)</li>
              <li>Piano (no improvising)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <img className="rounded img-fluid col" src="picture-of-me.jpg"
