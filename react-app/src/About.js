            I'm always curious about how things work, or if things work. I
            like to dive into new technologies to find out exactly what makes
            them tick.
          </li>
          <li>
            I accept most things for what they are; because, most of the time
            there's either no reason or no way to change them.
          </li>
          <li>
            I listen to others, and I'm receptive to criticism. Though, I
            remember things best when I express them to others, so I might
            sound like I'm making excuses.
          </li>
          <li>
            I try to be positive and honest. In the rare case that I can't be
            both, I prefer being honest.
          </li>
          <li>
            I have some hobbies...
            <ul className="About-SubList">
              <li>
                Video games, board games, role-playing games, card games, word
                games. Any games.
              </li>
              <li>Baking</li>
              <li>Netflix/etc. - I like anime in particular</li>
              <li>Crossword puzzles</li>
