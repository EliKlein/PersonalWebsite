      As part of the Game Design Experience/Game Development Experience
    courses at UCSC, I teamed up with two others to create 
      <a
        href="https://gliou.itch.io/strands-of-existence-final"
      >
        this video game
      </a>
       for two players, which is close to a board game.
    </li>
    <li
      class="PortfolioItem"
    >
      As part of the pre-work at Rithm School, we created a "
      <a
        href="memegen/format.html"
      >
        meme generator
      </a>
      " which lets you put arbitrary text on top of arbitrary images.
    </li>
    <li
      class="PortfolioItem"
    >
      Another part of the pre-work was 
      <a
        href="memory/page.html"
      >
        this
      </a>
       memory game project.
    </li>
    <li
      class="PortfolioItem"
    >
      I designed 
      <a
        href="https://eliklein.github.io/PersonalWebsite/portfolio"
      >
        this cliche joke about recursion
      </a>
       to demonstrate that I can use React.
