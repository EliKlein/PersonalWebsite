          I'm always curious about how things work, or if things work. I like to dive into new technologies to find out exactly what makes them tick.
        </li>
        <li>
          I accept most things for what they are; because, most of the time there's either no reason or no way to change them.
        </li>
        <li>
          I listen to others, and I'm receptive to criticism. Though, I remember things best when I express them to others, so I might sound like I'm making excuses.
        </li>
        <li>
          I try to be positive and honest. In the rare case that I can't be both, I prefer being honest.
        </li>
