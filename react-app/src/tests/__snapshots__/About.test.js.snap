          I'm always curious about how things work, or if things work. I dive into new technologies to find out exactly what makes them tick. I also sometimes experiment with bizarre code (on my own) to see if it does what I think it will.

        <li>
          I accept things for what they are. When I want things to change, it's based in solid reasoning, and I have the ability to instigate the change I want.

          I listen to others, and I'm good at acting on criticism. Honestly, in person I probably seem like I'm making excuses, but I do that to help myself understand what I can do better.

          I avoid false praise because I don't like lying. If I'm not a fan of something, I still know what parts I do appreciate, and if I can't focus on that, I think about what could be improved.

          I'd like to mention some hobbies now:

            </li>
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>
              Puns (maybe more of a personality trait than a hobby)
            </li>
            <li>
