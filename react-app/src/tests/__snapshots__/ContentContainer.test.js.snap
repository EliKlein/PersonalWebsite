              I'm always curious about how things work, or if things work. I like to dive into new technologies to find out exactly what makes them tick.
            </li>
            <li>
              I accept most things for what they are; because, most of the time there's either no reason or no way to change them.
            </li>
            <li>
              I listen to others, and I'm receptive to criticism. Though, I remember things best when I express them to others, so I might sound like I'm making excuses.
            </li>
            <li>
              I try to be positive and honest. In the rare case that I can't be both, I prefer being honest.

          As part of the Game Design Experience/Game Development Experience
    courses at UCSC, I teamed up with two others to create

           with another student as a pair. This uses Bootstrap and Express.
    In case you want to try make an account-- the e-mail address doesn't
    matter. You should make one up. There is also a premade account called
    "public" with the password "public".

          As part of the pre-work at Rithm School, we created a "
